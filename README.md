## Notes

My understanding of the files automatically installed by Node.js/React (packages.json, node_modules, package-lock.json, vite.config.js, eslint.config.js, public, index.html, src, README.md)
Index.html serves as the basic html container of the website specifying the head and body. The head contains meta-data plus the icon corresponding to the website tab header and title of the tab website header. The body has two tags - a div tag to act as a container for the React application. Think of this as an empty stage where no actors are present yet. The second statement with the script tag Loads the JavaScript file (main.jsx) that initializes and renders the React application. This is the director who then brings on the actors (React components) to perform on stage.
Src contains the bulk of the code that corresponds to the React application.
README.md is a simple markdown document for writing down documtnation of what the app does.
Packages.json is for specifying all of the libraries, dependencies and tools of React, Site, ESLint etc. Node_modules stores all the dependencies the user downloads and uses from the libraries/tools of packages.json. Package-lock.json ensures that all of the dependencies of the node_modules will stay in their current versions and not accidentally update leading to unpredictable behavior. Vite.config.js and eslint.config.js are both used to config vite and eslint. And public is to hold static assets such as images or files that dont require processing by Vite.
